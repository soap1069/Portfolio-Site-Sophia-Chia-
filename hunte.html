            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p> I designed HUNTE for my keystone project in the CareerFoundry UX design course. I am inspired by the social opportunities that technology can offer, so working on a social scavenger hunt app with the aim of connecting people from
              different paths of life was a very exciting project for me. I also decided to expand more on the app beyond the project scope as I was encouraged by the feedback from the testers that they would love to use the app. </p>

        <h2>1 Understand</h2>
        <h3>Market & Competition</h3>
        <p>Many competitors occupy the scavenger hunt app market. Most are catered to businesses, schools, or events where users can build their own hunts. They are also not catered to helping users seek people to play with, but assume an already
          established relationship among users that hunt together. Few receive high ratings or have an active marketing strategy. I looked deeper into Let’s Roam and Actionbound, two of the more dominant apps in the app store in terms of
          popularity and ratings, to benchmark features and design.</p>

        </picture>
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Having understood the market and competitor products better, I wanted to understand if playing scavenger hunts with players from an app was appealing, and what preferences people had around such games. I conducted interviews with
          potential users in order to better understand user needs and thoughts around travel and scavenger hunt apps and clustered the insights using affinity mapping. 6 main themes were clustered: travel needs, social needs, gaming format,
          tasks & content, safety & trust, and experience and knowledge.</p>
        <p>Notable points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Several interviewees spoke about the importance of using google maps for navigation --> It would be helpful to have maps to locate hunts and tasks.</li>
          <li>Interviewees stressed about coordination and communication if there are too many people in a hunt --> It is better to keep groups smaller. And assistive features such as group chats can be provided.</li>
          <li>Interviewees liked the idea of meeting people from different cultures & want to meet people with a similar traveling schedule and/or similar interests. --> It could be designed that users can easily identify other players by country
            or language.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>2 Empathize</h2>
        <h3>User personas</h3>
        <p>To empathize better with the user throughout the design process, I created user personas based on the interview participants I had met with. There are 2 target personas:</p>
        <p>Erik - A friendly introvert who seeks fun challenges and enjoys meeting people via online channels so he can filter for those who have the same interests.</p>
        <p>Tom - A curious and trendy person who travels a lot and likes to post about his unique and fun cultural experiences on social media.</p>

        <!-- close row that holds (2) columns -->
        <h3>User journeys</h3>
        <p>I created user journeys based on the personas in order to visualize the process the user would go through to accomplish his or her goal. This helped me better understand the pain points and emotions of the user in context. Erik is
          bored at home and is looking for someone to hand out and do something out of the ordinary with. Tom is traveling alone and wants to explore the city in an unconventional way, and ideally with a local or traveler from another culture
          or nationality. I explore the tasks, thoughts, feelings that the two personas would go through to eventually play a scavenger hunt with new friends.</p>

        <!-- close row that holds (2) columns -->
        <h3>Task analysis and user flow</h3>
        <p>I then created user flows based on my users objective to clarify the main pages and screens the user would go through to achieve his/her goal. A task analysis is also conducted for each objective to help determine what tasks
          are required to complete the goal and define the overall flow and experience of the user.</p>

        <h2>3 Ideate</h2>
        <h3>Wireframes & prototype</h3>
        <p>Having the research and user analysis under my belt, I gathered my learnings and went to the ideation process, which involved a lot of iterative sketching. The result were low fidelity wireframes that could already be used to
          collect feedback and identify areas for refinement. After several design iterations involving rounds of feedback, I created mid-fidelity wireframes, which were then used for user testing. The sketches and low-fidelity wireframes
          were created with pencil and paper, the mid-fidelity wireframe was created with Balsamiq and the mid-fidelity prototype was created with Sketch.</p>

        <h2>4 Test</h2>
        <h3>Usability testing</h3>
        <p>Usability testing allowed me to identify issues and make changes quickly to my app. A total of 6 test participants were recruited for the first round of testing. Test participants were in their 20s or 30s and have traveled at
          least twice a year to different countries, and were similar to my target personas. All test participants took an in-person moderated test, which gave me the opportunity to also observe their facial and body expressions.</p>
        <h4>TEST OBJECTIVES</h4>
        <h5>General navigation</h5>
        <p>‍Do users understand navigation menu? Can users easily navigate from one part of the app to another? Are there any frictions in navigation?</p>
        <h5>‍Find a hunt</h5>
        <p>‍Can users successfully move through the flow of finding and joining a hunt? Do users understand what is the relationship between a hunt and a meetup?</p>
        <h5>‍Manage friend list</h5>
        <p>‍Can users add a player as friend? Do they know how to see if they have any friend requests?</p>
        <h5>‍Edit profile</h5>
        <p>‍Do users know where to go to edit their profile? Do they know how to change their profile image?</p>
        <h4>TEST OBJECTIVES</h4>
        <p>Usability issues were rated on the Nielsen Scale (0 = no issue, 4 = imperative to fix)</p>
        <h3>Results analysis</h3>
        <h4>RAINBOW SPREAD SHEET</h4>
        <p>I used a rainbow spread sheet to organize my findings from the usability tests. Errors, observations, positive and negative quotes were listed, tallied and prioritized. Based on this, I also came up with possible solutions and
          next steps to adjust my existing app design.</p>

        <h4>ISSUES & SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>5 discovered issues were prioritized for design adjustments: </p>

        <p>Solution: Add "Go to profile" in the menu where the profile page can be accessed</p>

        <p>Solution: Add a map view to the home page so users can see where all the hunts are located</p>

        <h3>Style guide</h3>
        <p>After making the changes to the app based on user feedback, it was time to refine the UI. I created a style guide for the app so there is a consistent style applied for all the design assets and elements. I chose bold and high
          contrast colors and playful font because I want to give an exciting and fun mood to the app.</p>

        <h3>Final product design</h3>
        <p>Though the project is completed for the UX course, there are still parts of the app that I would like to add and change. I am very happy to have received lots of feedback from testers as well as peer UX designers, which
          have enabled me to make significant changes to the app since its first draft and given me the confidence that the usability has improved a lot. Here's a teaser for the final look, but please do check out the link below also
